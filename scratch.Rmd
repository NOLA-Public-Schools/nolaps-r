```{r setup}
library(nolaps)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
enrollment <- getdata_enrollmentderivation() %>%
  filter(BegSchSessYr == 2023) %>%
  collect()
```


```{r}
program <- getdata_program() %>%
  collect()
```

```{r}
program2 <- getdata_program() %>%
  collect()
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
